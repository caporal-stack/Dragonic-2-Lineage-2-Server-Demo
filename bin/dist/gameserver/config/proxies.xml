<!-- This list should contain GameServer IPs. IP of the GameServer will be chosen for Player during Server Selection, based on Mask of his IP -->

<!-- For example, if IP of the player is 153.4.138.226, all of the masks below will be checked if IP matches range of mask -->
<!-- Mask 0.0.0.0/3 covers IPs from 0.0.0.0 to 31.255.255.255. Mask 32.0.0.0/3 covers IPs from 32.0.0.0 to 63.255.255.255 and so on -->
<!-- So if IP of the player matches below mask, value in "ip" will be given to him, to connect with GameServer -->
<!-- If player IP will not match any mask, Error in LoginServer logs will be printed -->
